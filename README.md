# Supermatrix-AI: Philippine Energy and Mineral Mapper

**Description:**  
This project maps mineral and energy resources in the Philippines using NASA data, NASA partner datasets, and local Philippine datasets. It leverages AI-assisted analysis for resource identification and predictive mapping.

**Features:**  
- Mineral and energy resource mapping (oil, gas, metals)  
- AI-assisted analysis and prediction  
- Integration with Google Earth Engine for geospatial visualization  

**Setup Instructions:**  
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`  
2. Run scripts in `scripts/` folder  
3. Use `gee_scripts/` for Earth Engine visualization

**AI Tools Used:**  
- Python AI libraries for data analysis (TensorFlow, PyTorch)  
- Google Earth Engine for spatial analysis
