Slide 1 – Project Overview

Title: Supermatrix-AI: Philippine Energy & Mineral Mapper

Content:

Purpose: Map metal & energy proxies (Gold, Silver, Platinum, Copper, Nickel, Iron) across the Philippines

Data Sources: NASA + partner datasets (Landsat, Sentinel-2, ASTER, EMIT, VIIRS, GRACE, SMAP, SRTM, EMAG2, GEDI, ECOSTRESS)

Outputs: Proxy maps, hotspot vectors, raster exports, metadata (area, depth, volume)

Note: All outputs are proxies – field validation required

Visual Suggestion:

Map of Philippines as AOI with layered satellite imagery

Slide 2 – Data & Assets

Title: Earth Observation Datasets Used

Content:

Raster Sources: Landsat 8/9, Sentinel-2, ASTER, EMIT, SRTM, ALOS, EMAG2

Global Observations: VIIRS nightlights, GRACE gravity, SMAP soil moisture

Forest & Topography: GEDI canopy height, ECOSTRESS LST/ET, slope from DEMs

Safe Loaders: Scripts handle missing datasets via placeholders

Visual Suggestion:

Table or icon grid showing each dataset with icon + date range

Slide 3 – Spectral Indices

Title: Spectral Indices for Metal Proxies

Content:

IOI (Iron Oxide Index): Landsat Red & Green bands

Clay Proxy: SWIR bands (Landsat / ASTER)

Carbonate Proxy: NIR/SWIR bands

ASTER Iron: (B2–B1)/(B2+B1) scaled to 0–1

Normalization ensures safe [0,1] mapping for all indices

Visual Suggestion:

2–3 small maps showing IOI, Clay, ASTER Iron layers across Philippines

Slide 4 – Metal Proxy Computation

Title: Heuristic Proxy Mapping

Content:

Linear combination of indices and geophysical parameters:

GoldProxy = IOI*0.25 + Clay*0.20 + AST_Iron*0.10 + magAbs*0.20 + slope*0.05 + GEDI*0.10 + ECOSTRESS*0.10

Similar weighted formulas for Silver, Platinum, Copper, Nickel, Iron

Output: normalized [0,1] proxy layers

Visual Suggestion:

Color gradient maps for Gold, Silver, and Iron potential zones

Slide 5 – Hotspot Extraction

Title: Hotspot Identification & Attributes

Content:

Thresholding: proxy > 0.7 → hotspot polygons

Attributes per hotspot:

metal, meanVal, area_m2, depth_m (heuristic), volume_proxy_m3, lon/lat

Top clusters extracted for each metal for mapping & export

Visual Suggestion:

Map with red polygons overlaid on proxy raster

Table snippet showing first 5–10 hotspots with area & depth

Slide 6 – Export & Analysis Workflow

Title: Export & Analyze Metal Proxy Data

Content:

Hotspot Table Export (CSV) – centroid, area, depth, volume, metal type

Raster Export (GeoTIFF) – 100 m resolution, CRS EPSG:4326

Google Earth Engine Inspector – interactive pixel-level checks

Notes:

Outputs are proxies only, field validation required

Missing datasets handled with safe placeholders

Right: CSV table + GeoTIFF preview in QGIS

Slide 7 – Next Steps & Validation

Title: Validation & Deployment Plan

Content:

Ground Truth: ICP-MS sampling, geophysics surveys

Integration: QGIS / ArcGIS for spatial analysis & overlay

Refinement: Update weights and thresholds based on field data

Applications: Mining exploration, energy planning, hazard assessment

Visual Suggestion:
