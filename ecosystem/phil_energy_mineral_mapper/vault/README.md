# PHEMM Vault

This directory is populated by FusionLinker jobs and the helper scripts:

- `aoi/` – GeoJSON area-of-interest outputs.
- `reV_runs/` – reV supply-curve extraction results and generation outputs.
- `geophires_runs/` – GEOPHIRES-X reports per scenario.
- `gempy_models/`, `aster_exports/`, `osr_ml/`, `web/` – reserved for future integrations.

The folder is tracked empty so downstream processes know where to find results. Generated artifacts (CSV, JSON, TIF) remain untracked by Git.
